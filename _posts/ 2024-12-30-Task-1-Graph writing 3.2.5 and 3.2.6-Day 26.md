### Writing Task 2: Pie chart and comparison

#### Question
The pie charts below show units of electricity production by fuel source in Australia and France in 1980 and 2000.
Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.

#### Essay
The charts compare the amounts of electricity created by different energy sources in two countries in 1980 and 2000.
The total electricity production in Australia increased significantly from 100 units to 270 units. Most of the growth came from the power generated by coal, which more than doubled to 130 units in 2000, and from the energy created by hydro power, which increased significantly from 20 to 36 units. These two energy sources, however, created only 25 units and 2 units respectively in France. 
France also saw a marked increase in electricity production, reaching 180 units in 2000. Nuclear power was the primary energy source in this country, with the figure rising more than eightfold to 126 units in 2000, while it was not used in Australia. Oil was also much more important in France(25 units in 2000) than in Australia(only 2 units in the same year). Natural gas, by comparison, was insignificant for both countries, with 2 units only in 2000.
Overall, Australia relied more on coal than on any other energy source, and in France, nuclear power was the primary source. The proportion of electricity created by these two fuels increased markedly over the 20-year period in the respective countries, whereas the figures for the other energy sources- with the exception of hydro power in Australia-dropped correspondingly.

#### Question
The below give information on the ages of the populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and projections for 2050.
Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.

#### Essay
The pie charts show the proportions of 3 different age groups in two countries in 2000, as well as projected figures for the year 2050.
In Yemen, people aged 15 to 59 are projected to represent the largest proportion of the population at 57.3% in 2050, up from 46.3% in 2000. A totally different pattern is expected to be seen in Italy for this age group, with the figure dropping significantly from 61.6% to 46.2%, although in both years, this age group was and will be the biggest part.
Both countries are likely to see an increase in the population aged 60 or older. In Italy, the projection is that over-60s make up 42.3% of the entire population,significantly higher than 24.1% in 2000. In Yemen, the growth is much smaller-from 3.6% to 5.7%.
As for the youngest group, these two countries may experience the same change. The proportion of those aged 14 or younger in Yemen is likely to decline remarkably from 50.1% to 37%, while only a modest decrease is predicted for Italy from 14.3% to 11.5%.
Overall, both countries are projected to see their population grow older in 2050, with a smaller proportion of those under the age of 14 and a larger proportion of those aged 60 or above. In spite of these changes, the projection is that the 15-59 age group will be the biggest part in both countries.
