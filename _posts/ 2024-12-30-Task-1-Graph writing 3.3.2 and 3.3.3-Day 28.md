#### Essay
The chart, as well as the table, provides information about the causes of the world's land degradation and the severity of this problem in North America, Europe and Oceania in the 1990s.
Over-grazing is the primary cause of land degradation, with 35% of the world's land degradation attributed to this factor. It is followed by another two main causes, namely,deforestation and over-cultivation, contributing to 30% and 28% respectively. The remaining 7% is caused by other factors.
This appeared to be supported by the data presented by the table about the situation in the 1990s.Over-grazing was responsible for 11.3% of degradation in Oceania, 5.5% in Europe and 1.5% in North America, which, when combined, contributed to a larger proportion of land degradation than the other two factors.
Europe had a higher level of degradation than other two regions. Of the 23% of land degraded in Europe, 9.8% was caused by deforestation and 7.7% by over-cultivation, both higher than the proportion of degradation caused by these two factors in other two regions.
Overall, over-grazing is the main contributor to the world's land degradation. In total, the proportion of degradation attributable to this problem in these three regions was higher than the figure for either deforestation or over-cultivation.

#### Essay
The bar charts provide information about the proportion of students who studied for career or out of interest and also the percentage of students who received support from employers for education.
Up to 80% of people under the age of 26 studied for their careers, significantly higher than the proportion of people studying for personal interests(around 10%). The figure for career-driven education dropped with age and reached 40% for the 40-49 age group, on a par with the proportion of people of the same age studying for personal interests. Only 19% of people aged 49 or older studied for their employment prospects, significantly lower than the figure for their counterparts driven by personal interests.
Over 60% of people aged under 26 received employment support, compared with 50% of those aged 26 to 29 and only 33% of the 30-39-year-olds. About 35% of people aged 40 to 49 had their education supported by employers, in contrast to 42% of those aged 49 or over.
Overall, younger age groups(those under the age of 39) were more likely than their older counterparts to study for career. The likelihood of gaining assistance from employers was also relatively high before people turned 30.
