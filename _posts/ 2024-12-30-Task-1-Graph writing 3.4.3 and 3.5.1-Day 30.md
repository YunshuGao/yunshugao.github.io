The diagrams provide information about different life stages of salmon, including the time each stage takes and the places where salmon stay.
At the first stage, salmon lay eggs in the slow-moving upper reaches of the river, where there are reeds and small stones. Hatching takes about 5 to 6 months until small fish, also known as fry, emerge from the eggs. Each baby fish is about 3 to 8 cm in length when it is born. In the next step, these young salmon swim downstream to the lower river, where water flows much faster, and stay there for a period of 4 years. They are termed 'smolt', each about 12-15 cm long, at this stage.
At the maturation stage, salmon travel to the open sea and spend about 5 year there, during which time they grow into maturity. The size of each fish is about 70-76 cm, around six times as much as that of a smolt. Adult fish swim upstream from the sea to the upper river, where their life begins, to deposit eggs. The cycle thus begins anew.
Overall, the whole life cycle of salmon consists of four stages and sees significant changes in the aquatic locations where they live, from fresh water in the first stage and then saltwater in the field.

#### Essay
The two images show the changes to an island which has been developed for tourism.
The island was previously empty without any man-made structures, but now, a number of key facilities have been made available for visitors. There is a reception in the middle,linked with a restaurant to the north by a vehicle track. Two clusters of accommodation huts have been built in the east and west, connected with each other by footpaths.
These footpaths also lead to two other new features of the island. The first is the pier on the southern end, which allows boats to berth. This can make the island more accessible to tourists. The other is a swimming area next to the beach on the western tip, attracting those holidaymakers who are keen on seaside activities. In contrast, the eastern part of the island remains basically undeveloped with nothing apart from trees.
Overall, while orginally untouched, the island now has a variety of facilities which have been built to cater for the needs of tourists, such as dining, lodging, yachting and swimming.
