#### Essay
The diagrams illustrate the proposed changes to the central area of a town named Islip.
One major development, according to the plan, is the pedestrianisation of the main road which currently runs through the centre from west to east. Another principal change is the building of a dual carriageway around the centre, which can divert traffic and make the central area pedestrian-only.
There is a row of shops along either side of the current main road. In the future, while the shops along the south side remain, those along the oppositeside are set to be demolished to make way for a bus station, shopping centre, car park and new housing area. To the south of the shops is a park, which is expected to be reduced in size to allow for new housing developments. Finally, the school and housing on the southern edge of the centre are likely to remain, but outside the carriageway.
Overall, the majoy developments proposed to the Islip town centre include the construction of a new ring road and the pedestrianisation of the main road, which will lead to subsequent changes to transportation, shopping facilities and residential areas.

#### Essay
The diagrams show the planned changes to a university's sports centre.
Currently, visitors can enter the centre from the north entrance and see the reception immediately. Behind it, they can use a 25 m pool-with its changing room and seating on either side- and a gym at the back. While the entrance and the pool are planned to remain unchanged, the reception area is set to become bigger to include a sports shop and a cafe.
At present, there are also outdoor courts next to the centre on the east and west side, but both are set to be removed to make ways for the extension of the centre, which is estimated to be tree times as big as it is now. On the site of these courts, there are expected to be a leisure pool in the west wing, and a sports hall and two dance studios in the east wing. Two new changing rooms are also planned to be provided in the southwestern and southeastern corners to satisify potential demands.
Overall, one fundamental change proposed to the sports centre is to make it versatile, with a great variety of facilities to meet diverse needs of users, although no change is planned for the 25 m pool.
