some people believe that allowing children to make their own choices on everyday matters (such as food, clothes and entertainment) is likely to result in a society of individuals who only think about their own wishes.Other people believe that it is important fo children to make decisions about matters that affect them.Discuss both these views and give your own opinions.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.


#### My Essay
Some people think that let kids make all their owns decisions leads to self-centred, which is not good for their future development, while others believe it is essential to let children make their independent decisions.This essay will discuss both sides of this topic and their pros and cons. In my opinion, let children make daily life descions but keeping an eye on their big decision such as university and career selection will be a good choice.
