#### My first Essay draft
Introduction: Some people argue that history is one of the essential subjects in school, while others believe that it's neccessary to learn STEM subjects such as science and technology nowadays.In my opinion, while history as part of humanity is indeed important for students, science and technology can play a big role in students' future lives.

For example, when learning world war two, students are required to use sources to re 审视 the proporady of world war two, which are good methods to pratice their critical thinking skills. 

Body paragraph 2: On the other hand, science and technology, which are part of STEM subjects, are also very important. Science teaches students how to find or develop their research questions and build solutions. And technology helps students develop their digital literacy and fit in this rapid-envolving world. 

Body paragraph 3: In my opinion, Science and Technology especially computer technology are more important than history. Research shows that students with major in technology are more easily to find a job than students major in history. And the average salary of students in computer science is above other majors.On top of that, although learning history can students cultivate their critical thinking, they can also learn critical thinking outside school and classroom. As a result, students benefits more by learning science and technology rather than history.

Conclusion: In conlusion,school subjects such as science and technology are more important than history, and we could enrourage students to learn these subjects and cultivate their practical skills.
