### Writing Task 2: Environmental Issues

#### Idea bank
Rising global temperatures are likely to accelerate the melting of polar ice caps, resulting in rising sea levels.Consequently,extreme weather events, such as flooding and droughts, may become increasingly frequent.
The increasing world population is putting pressure on natural resources, and fossil fuels such as oil and gas are rapidly depleting.
Human activities,including the large-scale destruction of rainforests, are causing the loss of wildlife habitats.As a result, numerous species of animals and plants have become extinct.

Governments can implement stricter regulations to reduce emissions from factories and invest heavily in renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower.Additionally, imposing "green taxes"on drivers and airline companies could encourage more environmentally friendly practices.Public awareness campaigns could also be launched to promote recycling and sustainable living.

Individuals also have a responsibility to adopt greener lifestyles.For instance, they could reduce the number of flights they take for holidays abroad and opt for public transport instead of driving.Additionally, choosing products with minimal packaging and making an effort to recycle as much as possible can significantly contribute to environmental sustainability.

The amount of waste generated by society has significantly increased, largely due to our consumer-driven culture. Modern products are often designed with a limited lifespan,encouraging a throwaway mentality. As a result, when items break, people tend to discard them and purchase replacements instead of repairing them.

#### My First Essay Draft
While some people believe that the big part of environmental issues is the loss and endanger of plants and animals.Others argue that we have more challenging environment problems needing to be addressed.In my opinion, we should view environmental problems as a holistic challenge as each environmemntal issue is important equally.

The loss of particular species of plants and animals is undoubtedly a serious environmental problem nowadays.With the development of human space, more and more ecology space has been damaged,causing the endanger of particular species.In addition, the speed of extinction rate of several species has gone up, which make it hard to protect those species from extinction.As a result, the stable of ecosystem has been under great chanllege if we lose more and more species.

On the other hand, we're also faced with other serious environmental chanllenges such as pollutions, deforestion, and climate change.
