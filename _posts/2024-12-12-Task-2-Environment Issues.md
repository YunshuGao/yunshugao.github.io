### Writing Task 2: Environmental Issues

#### Idea bank
Rising global temperatures are likely to accelerate the melting of polar ice caps, resulting in rising sea levels.Consequently,extreme weather events, such as flooding and droughts, may become increasingly frequent.
The increasing world population is putting pressure on natural resources, and fossil fuels such as oil and gas are rapidly depleting.
Human activities,including the large-scale destruction of rainforests, are causing the loss of wildlife habitats.As a result, numerous species of animals and plants have become extinct.

Governments can implement stricter regulations to reduce emissions from factories and invest heavily in renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower.Additionally, imposing "green taxes"on drivers and airline companies could encourage more environmentally friendly practices.Public awareness campaigns could also be launched to promote recycling and sustainable living.

Individuals also have a responsibility to adopt greener lifestyles.For instance, they could reduce the number of flights they take for holidays abroad and opt for public transport instead of driving.Additionally, choosing products with minimal packaging and making an effort to recycle as much as possible can significantly contribute to environmental sustainability.

The amount of waste generated by society has significantly increased, largely due to our consumer-driven culture. Modern products are often designed with a limited lifespan,encouraging a throwaway mentality. As a result, when items break, people tend to discard them and purchase replacements instead of repairing them.


#### Question
Some people say that the main environmental problem of our time is the loss of particular species of plants and animals.Others say that there are more important environmental problems. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

#### My First Essay Draft
While some people believe that the big part of environmental issues is the extinction of plants and animals.Others argue that we have more challenging environment problems needing to be addressed.In my opinion, we should view environmental problems as a holistic challenge as each environmemntal issue is important equally.

The loss of particular species of plants and animals is undoubtedly a serious environmental problem nowadays.With the development of human space, more and more ecology space has been damaged,causing the endanger of particular species.In addition, the speed of extinction rate of several species has gone up, which make it hard to protect those species from extinction.As a result, the stable of ecosystem has been under great chanllege if we lose more and more species.

On the other hand, we're also faced with other serious environmental challenges such as pollutions, deforestion, and climate change.For instance, air pollutions in urban area cause several health problems.People are constantly exposed on high air pollutions have more chance to get cancer. And because of the climate change, the extreme weather events happend frequently than before. Spain suffered from rare flooding events two months ago, causing high damage and loss.

In my opinion, there're causal effects inside the environmental problems, and we should take them as holistic challenges. For example, as the increasing of population, human put a lot pressure on natural resources.The huge demanding of and residential land and wood leads to large-scale destruction of rainforests, damaging the habitat of plants and animals,putting them on threat of extinction. So if we pay efforst to deforestion, we can not only protect our rainforests, but only protect these species relying on the rainforests.

In conclusion, faced with environmental issues, people have various ideas whether we should prioritize protecting several species.But environmental issues is a holistic challenges.

2. The loss of particular species of plants and animals is undoubtedly a serious environmental problem nowadays.With the development of human space, more and more ecology space has been damaged,causing the endanger of particular species.In addition, the speed of extinction rate of several species has gone up, which make it hard to protect those species from extinction.As a result, the stable of ecosystem has been under great chanllege if we lose more and more species.

The loss of certain species is undoubtedly a critical environmental issue today. Human activities, such as urban expansion, have destroyed significant ecological spaces,putting many species at risk of extinction.Furthermore,the rate of species extinction has accelerated,making it increasingly difficult to protect them. As a result, the stability of ecosystems faces significant challenges as more species are lost.


3. On the other hand, we're also faced with other serious environmental challenges such as pollutions, deforestion, and climate change.For instance, air pollutions in urban area cause several health problems.People are constantly exposed on high air pollutions have more chance to get cancer. And because of the climate change, the extreme weather events happend frequently than before. Spain suffered from rare flooding events two months ago, causing high damage and loss.
   
On the other hand, we also face other critical environmental challenges, such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change.For instance, air pollution in urban area causes severe health problems.People exposed to high levels of air pollution are at greater risk of developing cancer.Additionally, climate change has led to more frequent extreme weather events.For example, Spain experienced severe flooding two months ago, resulting in significant damage and loss.


4. In my opinion, there're causal effects inside the environmental problems, and we should take them as holistic challenges. For example, as the increasing of population, human put a lot pressure on natural resources.The huge demanding of and residential land and wood leads to large-scale destruction of rainforests, damaging the habitat of plants and animals,putting them on threat of extinction. So if we pay efforst to deforestion, we can not only protect our rainforests, but only protect these species relying on the rainforests.
   
In my opinion, there are causal relationships among environmental issues, and they should be addressed as holistic challenges.For example, population growth places immense pressure on natural resources. The high demand for residential land and timber has led to large-scale deforestation,destroying habitats and pushing many species toward extinction.By addressing deforestation, we can not only protect rainforests but also safeguard the species that depend on them.


5. In conclusion, faced with environmental issues, people have various ideas whether we should prioritize protecting several species.But environmental issues is a holistic challenges.

In conclusion, while opinions may differ on whether we should prioritize protecting certain species, environmental issues should be addressed as holistic challenges to ensure a sustainable future.

#### My third draft
1. While some people believe that a major part of environmental issues is the extinction of plants and animals,others argue that more pressing environmental challenges need attention. In my opinion, environmental problems should be addressed as holistic challenges, as all issues are equally significant.  

While some believe that the extinction of plants and animals is the most critical environmental issue, others argue that other environmental challenges, such as pollution and climate change,require more urgent attention. In my opinion, environmental problems are interconnected and should be addressed holistically, as all issues are equally significant in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. 
    
2. The loss of certain species is undoubtedly a critical environmental issue today. Human activities, such as urban expansion, have destroyed significant ecological spaces,putting many species at risk of extinction.Furthermore,the rate of species extinction has accelerated,making it increasingly difficult to protect them. As a result, the stability of ecosystems faces significant challenges as more species are lost.

The loss of certain species is undoubtedly a serious environmental problem today. Human activities,including urban expansion and deforestation, have significantly damaged ecological spaces, pacing many species at risk of extinction.Additionally, the accelerated rate of species extinction has made it increasingly difficult to preserve biodiversity.For example, the destruction of rainforests for agricultural purposes has led to the disappearance of numerous plant and animal species.This threatens the stability of ecosystems, which depend on biodiversity for resilience and productivity.

3. On the other hand, we also face other critical environmental challenges, such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change.For instance, air pollution in urban area causes severe health problems.People exposed to high levels of air pollution are at greater risk of developing cancer.Additionally, climate change has led to more frequent extreme weather events.For example, Spain experienced severe flooding two months ago, resulting in significant damage and loss.

On the other hand, other environmental challenges, such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change, are equally pressing.For instance,air pollution in urban areas not only contributes to global warming but also poses severe health risks to humans, including respiratory diseases and cancer. Furthermore, climate change has led to more frequent extreme weather events, such as flooding and hurricanes, which cause significant damage to lives and infrastructure. A recent example is the severe flooding in Spain, which resulted in widespread destruction and economic loss. These challenges highlight the need for urgent action to address environmental problems beyond beyond the loss of species.

4. In my opinion, there are causal relationships among environmental issues, and they should be addressed as holistic challenges.For example, population growth places immense pressure on natural resources. The high demand for residential land and timber has led to large-scale deforestation,destroying habitats and pushing many species toward extinction.By addressing deforestation, we can not only protect rainforests but also safeguard the species that depend on them.

In my view, environmental issues are deeply interconnected, and treating them as isolated problems is ineffective. For example, population growth drives the demand for residential land and timber, leading to large-scale deforestation.This, in turn, destroys habitats and increases the risk of species extinction while also contributing to climate change.By tackling deforestation,we can protect not only rainforests but also the biodiversity and ecosystems they support. This demonstrates the importance of addressing environmental issues as part of a comprehensive strategy.

   
5. In conclusion, while opinions may differ on whether we should prioritize protecting certain species, environmental issues should be addressed as holistic challenges to ensure a sustainable future.

In conclusion, while some may argue that the loss of plants and animals should be prioritized, environmental problems are interconnected and require a holistic approach.By addressing these challenges collectively, we can ensure the long-term sustainability of our planet.
