### Writing Task 2: Situations

#### Question
Some people believe that it is best to accept a bad situation, such as an unsatisfactory job or shortage of money. Others argue that it is better to try and improve such situations. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

#### My Essay
When regarding to a bad situation,while some people think we'd better accept the bad situation, others believe we should fight to change these situations. In my opinion, we'd better accept for situations we can't control, but for situations we could change, we can do something to improve them.

Some situations such as unsatisfactory jobs or shortage of money,for some extent we might need to accept them. As unsatisfactory has 2 aspects, the first aspect is subjective feeling, the second aspect is objective feeling.If feeling unsatisfactory about the job, then might try to accept the job because there're not always satified jobs.For example, some jobs might have a good salary but far from home, and some jobs might could improve work ability but need to carry much more pressure. So there're not always satisfactory jobs, to accept this situation is a reality.

On the other side, for some situations it is better to change the situations.For an unsatisfactory job because of the toxic working environment, then if you don't change it as soon as possible, then the toxic working environment would ruin your mental health and cause more damage effects. And regarding to shortage of money, if it is actually shortage of money and impact the lives of family, so it is better to work hard to improve the family situations.

In my opinion, try to figure out the essence of situation and change the situations which are actually exists. For example, we can't change how others view us and their ideas, but we can control our own behaviours. For some situations, if it's only because our subjective altitude rather than the actually the circumstances of the work, so try to accept the job rather than change it, other than you'll always on the way of changing your job.

When faced with a bad situation, some people believe it is better to accept it, while others argue that we should take action to change it.In my opinion,we should accept situations we cannot control, but for those we can change, we should take steps to improve them.


2. Some situations such as unsatisfactory jobs or shortage of money,for some extent we might need to accept them. As unsatisfactory has 2 aspects, the first aspect is subjective feeling, the second aspect is objective feeling.If feeling unsatisfactory about the job, then might try to accept the job because there're not always satified jobs.For example, some jobs might have a good salary but far from home, and some jobs might could improve work ability but need to carry much more pressure. So there're not always satisfactory jobs, to accept this situation is a reality.

Some situations,such as unsatisfactory jobs or financial shortages, may require us to accept them to some extent.Unsatisfactory jobs, for instance, have two aspects: subjective dissatisfaction and objective circumstances.If the dissatisfaction is subjective, it may be better to accept the job because perfect jobs are rare.For example, some jobs may offer a good salary but require a long commute, while others may enhance skills but come with significant pressure.Accepting these imperfections is a practical reality.


3. On the other side, for some situations it is better to change the situations.For an unsatisfactory job because of the toxic working environment, then if you don't change it as soon as possible, then the toxic working environment would ruin your mental health and cause more damage effects. And regarding to shortage of money, if it is actually shortage of money and impact the lives of family, so it is better to work hard to improve the family situations.

On the other hand, some situations are better addressed by taking action to change them.For instance,if a job is unsatisfactory due to a toxic working environment,failing to leave it promptly could harm your mental health and lead a long-term negative effects. Similarly, in cases of financial hardship that affects a family's well-being, working harder to improve the situation is often the best solution.
 

4. In my opinion, try to figure out the essence of situation and change the situations which are actually exists. For example, we can't change how others view us and their ideas, but we can control our own behaviours. For some situations, if it's only because our subjective altitude rather than the actually the circumstances of the work, so try to accept the job rather than change it, other than you'll always on the way of changing your job.

In my opinion, it is important to analyze the essence of a situation and focus on changing those that can actually be improved.For example,while we cannot change how others view us or their opinions,we can control our own behaviour. Additionally,if dissatisfaction stems from subjective perspective rather than the actual circumstance of the work,it is better to accept the job.Otherwise, one may find themselves constantly searching for a new job without addressing the root cause of dissatisfaction.


In conclusion, while some bad situations require acceptance, others demand action to bring about change.By distinguishing between situations we can and cannot control, we can strike a balance between acceptance and improvement.
