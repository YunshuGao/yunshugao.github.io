## Reflection
Civics and citizenship teaches us to 'agree to disagree'.That is, we learn to form our own opinions but accept that other people will have different views.

## Democracy
The term democracy comes from the Greek words 'demos'(meaning citizen) and 'kratos'(meaning rule).
In most democratic societies, citizens are involved in the running of society by electing people who will represent them in government.Representatives of the people then develop policies and make laws on behalf of the people who have elected them.

The Australian House of Representatives is made up of the people we have elected to represent us in our democracy.

The freedoms are a very important part of living in a democracy as they allow us to participate and have a say in the way our country is run.

If we couldn't safely participate in our society, then it wouldn't be a democracy at all.

## Key Grammar Points for the Second Conditional
1. Purpose
   The second conditional is used for hypothetical or unlikely situations in the present or future and their imagined results.
   
2. Sentence Structure
   If + past simple, (then) + would/could/might + base verb
   The if-clause presents the imaginary condition.
   The result clause shows what would happen if the condition were true.
## It is sometimes referred to as
The phrase "it is sometimes referred to as" is a formal and academic way to introduce an alternative name, term, or concept that something is known by. It’s particularly useful in essays to clarify terms or provide additional context.
