## Key Ideas from *Civics and Citizenship*
| **Aspect**            | **Civics**                                | **Citizenship**                          |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Nature**             | Study of systems and structures.          | Active engagement and participation.     |
| **Focus**              | Knowledge about government and laws.      | Responsibilities and contributions of citizens. |
| **Goal**               | Understanding how society functions.      | Becoming an active, responsible member of society. |
| **Example**            | Learning about how elections work.        | Voting in an election or volunteering in your community. |


## Reflection
Civics and citizenship teaches us to 'agree to disagree'.That is, we learn to form our own opinions but accept that other people will have different views.

## Democracy
The term democracy comes from the Greek words 'demos'(meaning citizen) and 'kratos'(meaning rule).
In most democratic societies, citizens are involved in the running of society by electing people who will represent them in government.Representatives of the people then develop policies and make laws on behalf of the people who have elected them.

The Australian House of Representatives is made up of the people we have elected to represent us in our democracy.

The freedoms are a very important part of living in a democracy as they allow us to participate and have a say in the way our country is run.

If we couldn't safely participate in our society, then it wouldn't be a democracy at all.

## Key Grammar Points for the Second Conditional
1. Purpose
   The second conditional is used for hypothetical or unlikely situations in the present or future and their imagined results.
   
2. Sentence Structure
   If + past simple, (then) + would/could/might + base verb
   The if-clause presents the imaginary condition.
   The result clause shows what would happen if the condition were true.

## Review Grammar
Though you may aspire to be something other than a grammarian, knowing how to use proper grammar is always an advantage - especially in the workplace. Most jobs that provide you with a desk (and many jobs that don't!) demand that you know how to communicate in both speech and writing.
Good grammar
1. Better grades
2. Skill in communicating exactly what you mean
3. A higher-paying or higher-status job
4. Speech and writing that presents you as an educated, intelligent person
5. Polished skills in English as a second language

I honestly don't care whether you can identify an indirect object. I do, however, care a great deal about your ability to construct a complete sentence that communicates information clearly and meets the needs of your audience.

## Descriptive Grammar
1. Difinition: Descriptive grammar identifies and labels parts of speech(e.g., nouns, verbs) and explains what each word does in a sentence(its function).

## Functional Grammar
1. Functional grammar focuses on how words and sentences behave in real-life usage, ensuring the correct arrangement and expression of ideas.

## The key Formula
A little descriptive grammar + a lot of functional grammar = better grammar overall
Descriptive Grammar = The "labels" (what words are and their roles).
Functional Grammar = The "how-to" (making sentences work properly in real life)

## It is sometimes referred to as
The phrase "it is sometimes referred to as" is a formal and academic way to introduce an alternative name, term, or concept that something is known by. It’s particularly useful in essays to clarify terms or provide additional context.

# The Big Ideas of Grammar
Chooing the right words to get your point across to a reader or listener, putting those words in the right order, and(when you're writing) inserting the correct punctuation marks(commas,apostropes, and so on) in the correct places.
1. Selecting verb forms that match the subjects in your sentence
2. Using the right pronouns
3. Deciding between adjectives and adverbs
4. Choosing wisely between two(or more) words that sound similar or seem to be interchangeable(but aren't)
Each of these issues contributes to clear and correct communication.By paying attention to these areas, you can avoid common mistakes and improve your grammar.

Avoiding the repetitive sentences and expression and Spicing up boring sentences
1. Start by writing simple sentences like in the first paragraph.
2. Combine related sentences using conjunctions, modifiers, and transitions.
3. Add descriptive details and eliminate repetitive ideas.
4. Revise your sentences for variety and flow.
