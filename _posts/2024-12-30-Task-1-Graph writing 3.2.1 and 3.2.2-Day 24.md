#### Essay
The graph compares the volumes of goods delivered by four means of transport in the UK during the period 1974 to 2002.

Road was by far the most important mode of transport, with the figure increasing modestly from 70 million to approximately 80 million in 1994 and then rising even at a faster pace during the rest of the period to nearly 100 million tonnes in 2002. The amount of goods transported by water was lower: while it did record a significant growth from 40 million to around 70 million tonnes in 2002, the figure remained basically unchanged between 55 and 60 million tonnes for nearly two decades from 1982 to 1998.

By comparison, there was a dramatic fall in the figure for rail transportation from around 40 million tonnes in 1974 to 30 million tonnes in 1984, although it climbed back to over 40 million tonnes in 2002. The amount of goods delivered by pipeline recorded a steady growth from approximately 5 million tonnes in 1974 to over 20 million tonnes in 1995, and then remained at this level in the rest of the period. Despite the growth, it was the least popular means of transport.

Overall, almost every means of transport in UK saw an upward trend in the goods delivery with rail as the only exception. Road transportation delivered more goods than any other means of transport.
