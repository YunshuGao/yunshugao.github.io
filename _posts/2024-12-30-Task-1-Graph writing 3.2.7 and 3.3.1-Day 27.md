#### Essay
The bar charts show the changes in the percentages of boys and girls gaining impressive grades in different subjects in 1996 and 2000.
Humanities saw the biggest increase in the proportion of high-achieving boys, with the figure nearly doubling to 43% or so. By comparison, the figure for girls dropped by 8% to 25%. Similar changes happened to the arts, in which the percentage of boys who gained high scores increased significantly to 21% and the figure for girls decreased slightly to 25%. Languages were another course which experienced a drop in the percentage of high-achieving girls, down to 31%, and the proportion of high-achievers for boys remained unchanged at about 21% in this course.
There were contrasting patterns in the performance in science and maths for both genders. Around one third of boys gained satisfying grades in these science courses in 1996-higher than the figures for other subjects- but only around 18% and 17% reached this level in 2000. In contrast, the proportion of high-achieving girls in these two courses increased to 11% to 15% respectively, although these figures where still far lower than those for the other three subjects.
Overall, there were clear gender differences in all these five subjects: science subjects saw an improvement in the performance of girls, while the arts and humanities had a higher proportion of high-performing boys.In 2000, boys outperformed girls in every subject except the arts.

Health, by comparison, attracted more women than men(15% in comparison). A similar patterns was seen in Education, chosen by 10% of women and around 6% of men. Arts and Humanities were the favourite subject for females, with up to 19% of them choosing this subject, compared with 13% of men.
In contrast, the gender gap was narrow in two business subjects. 13% of women and 11% of men enrolled in Accounting & Economics, and smaller proportions of men and women selected Business Studies(6% and 8% respectively.)
Overall, men were more likely to choose Engineering or Science subjects than women, while the Arts and Education were favoured by a larger proportion of female students. In Business subjects, the gender difference was less clear.
