### Writing Task 1: Flow chart

#### Question
The diagrams below show the stages and equipment used in the cement-making process, and how cement is used to produce concrete for building purposes.
Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.

#### Essay
The charts illustrate how cement is produced and how it is used for the production of concrete.
The first step of cement production involves the crushing of limestone and clay in a crusher to create a power, which is subsequently mixed in a mixer. The mixture then goes through a rotating heater, which is heated with a device at the bottom, and then falls onto a conveyor belt.At the end of the belt, the mixture is ground by a grinder to create cement, which is packaged in bags.
As shown in the second chart, cement represents 15% of the raw material of concrete production, while water, sand and small stones make up 10%, 25% and 50% respectively. All these materials are blended in a concrete mixer, which rotates clockwise until concrete is made. It is a simple, two-step procedure.
To summarise, cement production consists of five steps, and its final product is combined with other ingredients to manufacture concrete. The former process is much more complex, as it involves the use of various devices and facilities.

#### Essay
The given diagram shows the process of producing electricity from geothermal energy.
The geothermal power plant has a store of cold water. This water is pumped underground from the surface to depth 4.5km, where an injection well sends the water directly through the geothermal zone-an area where the rocks are extremely hot. Passing through this area, water is heated to a high temperature. After passing through the geothermal zone, the now-hot water is pumped back to the surface by the production well, and into a condenser, where it becomes steam.
The steam is sent through a narrow tube, where it is used to power a turbine, which is turn powers a generator, which products electricity to be sent directly to the power grid.
In short, electricity is maded from geothermal power by the process of pumping water deep underground where it's heated, and then pumping it back up where the steam created indirectly powers a generator to create electricity.
