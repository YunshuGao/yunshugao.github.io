### Writing Task 2: Advertising

#### Question
Advertising aimed at children should be banned. To what extent you agree or disagree?

#### My Essay

### Introduction
Children are frequently exposed to advertisements that influence their preferences for snacks, toys, and video games. while some ads may provide educational benefits, I believe advertising aimed at children should be tightly regulated or banned when it promotes harmful products or behaviours.

### Body Paragraph 1
One major concern is that advertisements targeted at children often manipulate their emotions and encourage them to nag their parents for unnecessary products. For instance, some children are drawn to expensive toys or trendy outfits, pressuring parents to fulfill these materialistic demands. This can cause significant economic stress, particularly for low-income families, who may struggle to meet these expectations.

### Body Paragraph 2
Furthermore, advertisements often contribute to unhealthy lifestyle habits among children. 
### Body Paragraph 3

### Conclusion






#### Feedback
- Strength: Clear use of comparative phrases.
