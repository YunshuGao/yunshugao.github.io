#### My Essay

### Introduction
Affordable air travel has made it easier for ordinary people to explore distant places and broaden their horizons. However, some argue that this convenience comes at an environmental cost and should be discouraged by raising prices. In my opinion, while cheap air travel offers numerous benefits, its environmental consequences cannot be ignored, and a balanced approach is needed.

### Body paragraph 1
Cheap air travel enables more people to access opportunities that were once only available to the wealthy. For example, affordable flights allow students to study abroad, professionals to attend international conferences, and job seekers to explore career opportunities in different countries. Additionally, businesses benefit from lower transportation costs, facilitating international trade and economic growth. Without budget-friendly air travel, many people would miss these valuable opportunities, limiting global connectivity and personal advancement.

### Body paragraph 2
On the other hand, low-cost air travel significantly contributes to environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emissions, noise pollution, and ecosystem damage. For instance, the aviation industry is responsible for a substantial portion of global CO2 emissions, which accelerate climate change. Moreover, the expansion of airports and increased flight frequencies disrupt local habitats and communities. By raising ticket prices, governments can discourage non-essential travel, thereby reducing the environmental impact. This revenue could also be invested in developing sustainable technologies, such as more fuel-efficient planes or alternative energy sources.


### Body paragraph 3
While environmental concerns are valid, completely discouraging air travel may not be practical for those who live busy lives and rely on flights for work or leisure. Instead, airlines and governments should focus on technological advancements to make air travel more eco-friendly. For example, improving fuel efficiency and investing in electric or hybrid aircraft can reduce emissions without compromising affordability. Additionally, travelers can be encouraged to offset their carbon footprint by supporting reforestation projects or using alternative transport options like trains for shorter journeys.


### Conclusion
In conclusion, cheap air travel provides significant benefits by improving accessibility and fostering economic growth. However, its environmental costs cannot be ignored. A balanced solution involving moderate price adjustments, technological innovation, and public awareness is essential to ensure that air travel remains both affordable and sustainable.
