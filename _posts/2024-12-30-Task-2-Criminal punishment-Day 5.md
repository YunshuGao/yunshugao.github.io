### Writing Task 2: Criminal punishment

#### Question
A longer prison term as a way of punishing those who break the law is not as good as other methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

#### My Essay
**Send somebody who had made severe crimes to prison is considered to be a serious offender as punishment, at times, it also considered to be a correctional method. While this method has some advantages over main the societal order, we also should think about rehabilitate offenders to change criminers.**
*Imposing longer prison sentences on serious offenders is often viewed as a punitive measure and, at times, a corrective strategy. While this approach has certain benefits, particularly in maintaining society order, I believe alternative methods, such as rehabilitation and reintegration programs, are more effective in addressing the root causes of criminal behaviour.*


**Community services should be considered as another method, as it helps to make criminals into law-abiding citizens. Community services can cultivate a sense of responsibility of first-time offenders, and prevent them from hurting others.On contrast, if they are sentencecd to long prison, then they'll reoffend crimes, and pose threats other social members.**
*One effective alternative is community service, which transforms offenders into law-abiding citizens while allowing them to contribute positively to society.For instance, first-time offenders can develop a sense of responsibility by engaging in meaningful work, such as cleaning public spaces or assisting charitable organizations. This not only prevents them from reoffending but also helps them understand the consequences of their actions. In contrast, longer prison sentences often exacerbate criminal tendencies by exposing individuals to hardened criminals, thereby increasing the likelihood of recidivism and posing further risks to society.*

**We can also help the criminals improve their job skills and work capability by providing education and vocational training.Young offenders break because lack of social experience or low socio-economis status. If they could find a job and understand legal responsibilities, they might not likely to involve in law-breaking activities again. But if we send the young offenders in to prison, they'll get isolated from society, which would hinder them accqure job skillset and reintegrate into society.**
*Another productive approach is providing education and vocational training to offenders.Many young criminals resort to unlawful activities due to a lack of social experience or poor socio-economic conditions. By equipping them with skills and qualifications, they are better prepared to secure stable employment and avoid returning to a life of crime. For example, teaching young offenders legal awareness and job-specific skills can significantly reduce their chances of reoffending. Conversely, long-term imprisonment isolates them from society, stifling their opportunities for personal development and making reintegration more challenging.*

**On the other hand, a prision sentence serves as a deterent. Prison term means lose freedom for offenders, which will have adverse impact on their future lives. So that they won't commit offences out of facing punishment.**
*That said, prison sentences still play an essential role as a deterrent for certain crimes. The loss of freedom and the stigma associated with incarceration can dissuade potential offenders from engaging in unlawful activities.Moreover,for particularly heinous crimes, imprisonment serves to protect society by removing dangerous inviduals. However, relying sole on punitive measures like lengthy prison terms often fails to adress the underlying factors that lead to criminal behaviour in the first place.*

**In conlusion, I believe harsh penalty can deter crimes, but it is not the best option. We should change behaviours of criminals and make them productive members of society.**
*In conclusion, while harsher penalties such as extended prison sentences may deter crime to some extent, they are not the most effective solution. A comprehensive approach that focuses on rehabilitation, education, and reintegration is far more sustainable in fostering long-term societal harmony and tranforming offenders into productive members of the community.*
