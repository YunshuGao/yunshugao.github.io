### Writing Task 2: Debating

#### Question
Some people think school should only teach students academic subjects. Others think schools should also teach students how to discriminate between right and wrong. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

#### My Essay

### Introduction
Some believe that schools should concentrate solely on academic subjects to help students succeed in their careers, while others argue that teaching students to distinguish between right and wrong is equally important.In my opinion, schools should strike a balance by teaching both academic knowledge and moral values, as both are crucial for a student's overall development and future success.

### Body paragraph 1
Academic subjects are the foundation for career success, equipping students with essential knowledge and skills. These subjects enable students to perform well in exams, secure university admissions, and gain employment in specialized fields. For instance, studying mathematics and data analysis prepares students for careers as financial analysts or engineers.These technical skills significantly improve students' career prospects and job performance, ensuring long-term success in competitive industries.Without a strong academic foundation, students may struggle to find meaningful opportunities in the job market.

### Body paragraph 2
On the other hand, teaching students moral values and ethical principles is vital for their personal growth and contribution to society. Students who understand the difference between right and wrong are more likely to act responsibly,make ethical decisions, and show respect toward others. For example, socially responsible engineers prioritize safety and eco-friendly designs when creating products. Moreover, more education encourages students to collaborate effectively, resolve conflicts, and build meaningful relationships, which are essential for both their professional and personal lives.

### Body paragraph 3
Focusing solely on academics or ethics would be insufficient; a balanced approach is necessary.While academic subjects develop technical expertise, moral education builds character and interpersonal skills. For instance, a student excelling in academics but lacking a sense of respect and teamwork may struggle in the workplace.Coversely, a student who is courteous and collaborative but lacks subject knowledge may face challenges in pursuing a specialized career. By integrating both academics and moral education, schools can prepare students to become well-rounded inviduals who excel in their careers and contribute positively to society.


### Conclusion
In conclusion, schools should teach both academic subjects and moral values to ensure students' overall development. While academic knowledge is essential for career success, moral education equips students with the ethical framework needed to navigate life responsibly. A balanced curriculum will produce competent, ethical, and socially responsible inviduals.
