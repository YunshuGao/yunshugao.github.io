### Writing Task 2: Distance Education

#### Question
Nowadays,distance-learning programs have gained in popularity(those teaching programmes that involve the use of written materials, videos,televised lessons and the Internet), but some people argue that courses can never be as good as those taken by attending a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

#### My Essay

### Introduction
The advent of the Internet has revolutionised the ways of people work and live. A large number of people has considered distance education as it allows them pursue and complete degree courses at home.In my opinion, while distance education is different from traditional education, they share the same effection in most situations.

### Body paragraph 1
Distance education has various teaching tools and methods to help students understand contents and gain knowledge.Students needs to read relevate materials and do practice tests to acquire keys concepts and theories. Students can watch prerecorded lessons and attend lectures, When they have doubts on contents, they can pause the video and replay it until they undertand the content thoroutly. In another word, learning at home or in college can learn the same knowledge. 

### Body paragraph 2
Distance education also allows students interact with lectures.Students can use interactive communication tools in virtual classes and also send emails. As a result, they could receive guidance from the intructions of lecturer to finish courses better. At times, they can even communicate with scholars from world well-known universities even though they stay in their own countries.

### Body paragraph 3
Sometimes, students participating in distance learning cannot get same inspiration from other classmates and lecturers. As students joining distant education are normally at home, their interaction with teachers are limited in exercies and exams,to make it worse, they don't have interaction with other classmates. As a result, they can't learn from other through daily communication, such as study skills, work experience and wisdom of tackle problems. Moreover, students can learn theories through distance education, but they cannot gain as much knowedlge as they could in traditional education.

### Conclusion
In conlusion, during most of the time, distance learning can let students acquire same knowledge compared with traditional education. However, there're also disadvantages in distant education such as lack of interaction, so that they cannot have the same effect like tradition education.
