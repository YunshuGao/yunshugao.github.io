### Writing Task 2: Legislation
####  Questions
The effient functioning of society is based on rules and laws. Society would not function well if individuals were free to do whatever they wanted. To what extent do you agree of disagree? 

#### My Essay
**Laws are a set of rules and laws imposed on social members in case they act freely. I agree a proper set of laws can maintain the social order and encourage development as it helps individuals in society behave freely as well as within boundary.**
*Rules and laws are essential for maintaining social order and preventing chaos in society.I agree that an appropriate set of laws is crucial for the efficient functioning of society as it ensures inviduals can enjoy freedom within defined boundaries while promoting stability and progress*

**If social members are free to do whatever they wanted and disobey the laws, then no sicial orders would exist, which would restrain the development of economy.**
*If inviduals were allowed to act freely without adhering to laws,societal order would collase, leading to negative consequences for the economy.*

**As laws develop the social norms which let members of public get to know wether their behaviours accepted or not, the economy efficiency would get decrease if everyone act at will.**
*Laws establish social norms that guide inviduals on acceptable behaviour,forstering economic efficiency. Without these norms, the economy would suffer.*

**For example, if a few people don't obey traffic regulations, traffic accidents would increased, and making traffic congestion another problem.**
*For example, if traffic regulations were widely ignored, the resulting accidents and congestions would disrupt transportation systems.*

**Moreover, if people don't get to work on time, then the companies can't develiver good to constomers punctuallt, which ultimatelly undermines the economy.**
*Additionally, if employees failed to arrive at work on time, companies would struggle to deliver goods and services punctually, ultimately harming economy growth.*

**Moreover, if people act freely without obeying the rules and restrictions, they would do someting hurt others as some of the behaviours are driven by self-interests.**
*Moreover, unrestricted freedom could lead to actions driven purely by self-interest,often at the expense of others.*

**This would undermine the common interests of the public.** 
*This would undermine public welfare.*

**For instance, someone will self counterfeit goods in case of earn money, which cause damage to the rights of consumers.** 
*For instance,individuals might sell counterfeit goods for personal profit, voilating consumers' rights.*

**Some people even rob others for money, causing people dare to leave home as the society is not saft anymore.**
*In more severe cases, some might resort to theft or robbery, creating a society where people feel unsafe. Such a scenario would erode trust and hinder social cohesion.*

**However, laws too strict would limit individual freedom and even hinder the development of society.**
*However, excessively strict laws could stifle individual freedom and hinder societal development.*

**For example, if a country enforce strict business laws to business industry, it will curb business activities.**
*For example, overly rigid business regulations could suppress entrepreneurial activities, discouraging innovation and economic growth.*

**Another example is high income tax. If high-income people have to pay very high income tax, they might not be able to motivate enough to work hard and increase income.**
*Similarly, excessively high-income taxes might demotivate high earners from working harder, limiting their potential contributions to society.*

**To put another words, a society with very strict laws will not be better enough to develop potential and talents of its citizens.** 
*A society with overly restrictive laws risks failing to unlock the full potential and talents of its citizens.*

**In conclusion, the government should give individual freedom within the laws, which can not only maintain social norm, but also encourage a freely atmosphere in society.**
*In conclusion, while laws are essential for maintaining social norms and protecting public welfare, they must strike a balance to allow invidual freedom.*
