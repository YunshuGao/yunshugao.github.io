### Writing Task 2: Lifestyle

#### Question
Some people say that the government should ensure that people lead a healthy life, while others believe that individuals should have their own choices. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

#### My Essay
### Introduction
A healthy lifestyle is essential for well-being, dignity, and happiness. While some argue that inviduals should have the freedom to choose their way of living, I believe the government plays a crucial role in promoting healthy habits and regulating harmful behaviours to ensure public health.

### Body paragraph 1
Allowing inviduals to decide how they live can make them happier and more motivated. For instance, many people choose healthy lifestyles by eating fruits and vegetables, which help them stay fit, gain confidence, and enjoy life. These choices are often personal and voluntary, making them more sustainable. However, if inviduals are forced to follow strict government regulations, such as habits may feel like a burden rather than a personal achievement, reducing their motivation and enjoyment. Therefore, invidual freedom is essential for developing genuine and lasting healthy habits.

### Body paragraph 2
On the other hand, many people struggle with self-discipline and engage in harmful behaviours despite knowing the risks. For example, smoking damages health and reduce life expectancy, yet many continue due to addition or lack of awareness. Government measures, such as imposing higher taxes on cigarettes and banning smoking in public places, have proven effective in reducing these behaviours. By regulating destructive habits, the government not only protects public health but also helps inviduals who lack the willpower to make healthier choices independently.

### Body paragraph 3
In addition to regulations, governments should educate people about the importance of healthy living. For example, office workers with sedentary jobs may be unaware of the long-term health risks they face, such as obesity or reduced life expectancy. Public awareness compaigns can highlight these issues and encourage inviduals to adopt healthier habits, such as regular exercise or better dietary choices. Governments can also require food packaging to include nutritional information, helping people make informed decisions about their meals. Such initiatives ensure that inviduals have both the knowledge and tools to lead healthier lives.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, while inviduals should have the freedom to make lifestyle choices, the government has a responsibility to regulate harmful behaviours and promote public health through education and awareness. A combination of personal choice and government support ensures that people can lead healthier and happier lives.
