### Introduction
**Tax is regarded as a heavy burden for many people, as tax reduced their disposable income.**
*Taxation is often perceived as a significant burden because it reduces inviduals' disposable income.*

**, without tax revenue, society cannot function well.**
*Without tax revenue, the infrastructure and services crucial for societal progress would not function effectively.*

### Body Paragraph 1

*Governments can allocate tax revenue to the construction and maintenance of public facilities, such as road, schools and hospitals.*

**For example, an efficient public transport system can make it easy for people to commute, while traffic congestion will affect productivity.** 
*For instance, an efficient public transportation system funded by taxes can facilitate easier commutes,whereas traffic congestion hinders productivity.*

**Additionally, public schools supported by tax revenue can provide access to educational opportunities and knowledge for kids especially from disadvantaged background, which are essential for economy growth and social justice.** 
*Moreover, public schools supported by tax revenue ensure access to education for children,particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, fostering social equity.*

**On contrast, the private sector are unwilling to support these public projects because of the low profit margin.**
*In contrast, the private sector often hesitates to invest in such projects due to their low-profit margins.*

**Furthermore, we shall realise that goverments can achieve the goal of redistribute wealth and narrow income gap through imposing tax.** 
*Additionally, taxation enables governments to redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality.*

**For example, in many countries, the high income groups are required to pay more tax by the government while the low income groups will receive subsides from the government.**
*For example, in many countries, higher-income groups are required to pay more taxes, which allows governments to provide subsidies and financial support to lower-income households.*

### Body Paragraph 2
**Another advantage of levying tax is that it can regulate behaviour.** 
*Another advantage of taxation is its ability to regulate behaviour and encourage healthier lifestyles.*

**Most of the time people are lack of self-restraints,which make it hard to break bad habits.** 
*Individuals often lack the self-discipline to break harmful habits.*

**For example, impoving heavy tax on cigarette and alcohol can curb consumption as the tax make it expensive to purchase these items.** 
*For example, imposing heavy taxes on cigarettes and alcohol can discourage consumption by making these items more expensive.*

**On the long term, since people drink less alcohol and smoke less, which are beneficial to health, and also can alleviate the pressure to the medical system.**
*Over time, reduced consumption of these substances can lead to improved public health and alleviate the strain on healthcare systems.*

*Thus, taxation serves as a powerful tool to guide behaviour while addressing public health challenges.*

### Body Paragraph 3
**On the other hand, if people have to pay too much higher tax, people might think it is not necessary to work hard and set up business if they'd like to build their own business.** 
*On the other hand, excessive taxation can have negative effects on individual motivation and economic development. If people are required to pay disproportionately high taxes, they may lose the incentive to work hard or establish businesses.*

**Money set as a strong motivator for many people as it help me live a better life and gain a sense of achivement.** 
*For many, financial success is a significant motivator, as it enables them to improve their quality of life and achieve a sense of accomplishment.*

**However, without these people who are hardworking and innovative, a country can't grow rich and the government cannot sustain its social welfare system.**
*Without the contributions of hardworking and innovative individuals, a country risks stagnating economically and socially.*

### Conclusion
**In conclusion, I truly believe tax is essential for economy, but the tax too high will affect the economy negatively.**
*In conclusion, taxation plays a vital role in sustaining societal infrastructure, reducing inequality, and regulating harmful behaviours.*
*However, excessively high taxes could discourage productivity and innovation, ultimately harming the economy.*
*Therefore, while taxation is essential, it is crucial to strike a balance to ensure its positive impact on both individuals and society.*
