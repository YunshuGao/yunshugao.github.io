### Writing Task 2: School rules

#### Question
Some people think that children should obey rules and do what their parents and teachers what them to do. Other people think that children controlled too much cannot deal with problems themselves in adulthood. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.

#### My Essay
### Introduction
Some believe children should always follow the rules set by parents and teachers, while others argue that too much control harms their independence. In my view, rules are important, but children also need freedom to develop problem-solving skills and prepare for adulthood. 

### Body paragraph 1
Rules are essential for teaching children discipline, accountability, and respect. When children follow rules, they learn to differentiate between right and wrong, which shapes their behaviours. For example,school rules that discourage the use of offensive language not only maintain classroom order but also instill good manners in students.Similarly, house rules like completing chores on time teach children reponsibility and time management. These lessons build a foundation for success in adulthood, as children grow into inviduals who can work well in structured environments. Without such guidance, children may struggle to understand societal expectations or behave appropriately in different settings.

### Body paragraph 2
However, imposing too many rules can harm a child's ability to think critically and solve problems independently. When children are constantly told what to do, they may become overly reliant on instructions and struggle to adapt to unfamiliar situations. For instance, a child who is always told how to solve homework problems might lack creativity or confidence in finding solutions on their own. This overdependence can continue into adulthood, leading to challenges in handling complex decisions. Furthermore, excessive control may stifle a child's curiosity and willingness to explore new ideas, limiting their personal and intellectual growth. A lack of freedom can also cause frustration, reducing their motivation to learn and engage with their surroundings.

### Body paragraph 3
The best approach is to balance rules and freedom, adapting them to the child's age and maturity. Younger children need clear and strict guidelines to develop basic habits, such as saying "please" and "thank you" or asking for help politely. For instance, teaching a child to follow instructions in a classroom environment helps them understand boundaries and fosters cooperation. As children grow older, these rules should gradually loosen to allow more independence. For example, teenagers could be encouraged to research school projects online or resolve minor conflicts without parental intervention. Such a balanced approach ensures that children develop both the discipline to follow rules and the confidence to solve problems independently, preparing them for future challenges.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, rules are important for teaching children good behaviour and responsibility, but too much control can limit their independence. A balanced approach- where younger children follow stricter rules and older children are given more freedom- helps them grow into disciplined, confident, and capable adults.
