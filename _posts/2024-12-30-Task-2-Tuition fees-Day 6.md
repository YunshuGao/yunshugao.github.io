### Writing Task 2: Tuition fees

#### Question
In many countries, the proportion of older people is steadily increasing.Does this trend have positive or negative effects on society?

#### My Essay
Due to advancements in technology and rising wealth, life expectancy has significantly increased over the past several decades. 
ðŸ”´**Technological change and the increase in personal wealth have contributed to the improvement in life expectancy, and many countries have seen their population aging at an unprecedented pace.**
While an aging society allows older inviduals to contribute to society, the demographic shift also presents numerous challenges.

One problem associated with an aging population is the rapid increase in healthcare costs, which places a significant burden on taxpayers.Most medical needs and expenses tend to occur during the later years of life. As a result, the government needs to allocate more funds to taking care of elderly people, which may reduce the budget available for other key services such as education and social welfare.
ðŸ”´**One social problem related to population ageing is that the medical cost will increase dramatically and hurt the economy. As people age, their demand for medical care often rises due to age-related conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and chronic respiratory diseases. For instance, older adults may require long-term care, frequent medical checkups, and prescription medications, all of which contributes to increased government spending.Countries with a growing proportion of elderly citizens may need to allocate substantial portions of their budgets to healthcare, potentially diverting funds away from other essential sectors like education or infrastructure development.**

The slowing pace of work could be another issue associated with increasing number of senior workers. As people age, their ability to absorb information and complete tasks tends to slow down.If elderly people postpone their retirement and prolong their working lives, it could impact the productivity and profitability of companies.
ðŸ”´**Another problem is that the productivity of society may decline as the number of workers aged 65 and above increases.An aging society typically raises the retirement age to keep pension systems sustainable,meaning more senior workers remain in the labour force well into their 60s.For those in physically demanding industries, such as construction, mining and agriculture, the challenges can be particularly significant.These workers may face limitations in strength, stamina,and agility, making it harder to meet the physical requirements of their jobs.If older employees continue working in such roles, their reduced capacity to perform tasks efficiently could lead to slower work progress and decreased overall productivity.**

On the other hand, many people choose to delay retirement and extend their professional careers, bringing their experience and wisdom as valuable assets. Since people are living longer, they often choose to remain in their positions, where they are experts in their respective fields.They can work as consultants, passing on their knowledge and skills to younger generation. For example, some senior managers can teach younger employees how to manage a company and provide better services to customers.
ðŸŸ¢**On the other hand, it is possible that societies can tap into the wisdom and experience of elderly people.Having worked for decades, they are experts in their fields of work and have practical experience, specialist knowledge and work-related tips that they can share with younger generations. Senior business managers, for example, can teach young people how to manage a company and to deal with complaints and queries of clients, while veteran researchers can pass on their knowledge to young scientists about how to oversee and execute projects.**

In conclusion, the dramatic increase in life expectancy has placed significant pressure on healthcare systems in many countries and has also impacted workforce productivity. While the wisdom of older generations can be utilized, this demographic shift inevitable affect economic development.
**In conclusion, a rapidly aging population can impose a strain on the medical system and reduce the productivity in several key work sectors. While these societal challenges are difficult to address, tapping into the wisdom and experience of elderly individuals offers a valuable opportunity to create benefits for society as whole.**
