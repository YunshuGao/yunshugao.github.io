### Writing Task 2: Volunteer work

#### Question
Volunteer work organised by middle schools brings more benefits than problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

#### My Essay
### Introduction
Volunteer work has been promoted to many middle schools, which even be set as a requirement for graduation.In my opinion, while volunteer work has a beneficial effect to volunteers and communities, it has a disadvantage side.

### Body paragraph 1
For students, they can improve their qualities through joining serving the communities. Joining community services give them more chances to tackle problems and address challenges, which are rare in school settings. For example, when they raise funds for charitable organizations, they should learn to show patience and communicate with patrons patiently,also they will learn how to organize activities, which will improve their confidence in problem-solving ability.

### Body paragraph 2
On the meantime, young people also develop a sense of responsibility, and learn how to serve communities. they realise that their work can bring assistance to other community members, so they'll develop a sense of community. For instance, helping poor kids to learn is a responsibility as volunteers get to know that it is necessary to help others especially in disadvantage context acquire knowledge, which can help to create an equity and happy society.

### Body paragraph 3
On the other hand, we can't ignore that there exist a situation that community services waste volunteers' time and efforts without good plans. Some projects need young volunteers to work after school or on weekends. Because of the volunteer work, these volunteers find it difficult for them to focus on and finish homework. For some projects, it is not because that the volunteers unwilling to devote effort, but for they can't see the value of their work.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, my view is that volunteer work is esential for young people to improve their abilities and upgrade their skills. But organizations should make sure that volunteer work satisfy students' needs.
