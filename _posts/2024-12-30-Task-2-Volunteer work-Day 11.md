Additionally, they gain organizational skills by planning and managing events, which boosts their confidence and enhances their problem-solving abilities.*

**On the meantime, young people also develop a sense of responsibility, and learn how to serve communities. they realise that their work can bring assistance to other community members, so they'll develop a sense of community. For instance, helping poor kids to learn is a responsibility as volunteers get to know that it is necessary to help others especially in disadvantage context acquire knowledge, which can help to create an equity and happy society.**
*At the same time, volunteer work helps young people cultivate a sense of responsibility and fosters a deeper connection to their communities. By witnessing the tangible impact of their efforts, students realize the importance of contributing to the well-being of others. For instance, teaching underprivileged children highlights the value of sharing knowledge and supporting those in disadvantaged circumstances. Such experiences promote the ideals of equity and compassion, helping to build a more inclusive and harmonious society.*

**On the other hand, we can't ignore that there exist a situation that community services waste volunteers' time and efforts without good plans. Some projects need young volunteers to work after school or on weekends. Because of the volunteer work, these volunteers find it difficult for them to focus on and finish homework. For some projects, it is not because that the volunteers unwilling to devote effort, but for they can't see the value of their work.**
*On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge the challenges that poorly planned volunteer projects can create. Some initiatives require students to work after school or on weekends, which may interfere with their ability to complete homework and focus on academic responsibilities. Moreover, when projects lack clear objectives or meaningful outcomes, students may feel their time and effort are wasted. This can lead to frustration, not because of a lack of willingness to contribute, but due to the inability to see the value or impact of their work.*

### Conclusion

*In conclusion, I believe that volunteer work is essential for young people as it helps them develop skills, build character, and foster a sense of community. However, organizations must ensure that volunteer programs are well-structured and meaningful, aligning with students' needs and capabilities to maximize their benefits.*
