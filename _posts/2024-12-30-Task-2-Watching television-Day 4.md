### Writing Task 2: Watching Television

#### Question
***Some people believe that children can learn effectively by watching TV and should be encouraged to watch TV both at home and at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?***

#### My Essay
Watching Television especially informative television is regarded as the effective study method as audio-visual information is more likely to attract students and development their interests.While many TV programmes are of education value, I don't agree to encourage students to watch TV more.

Watching Television can make a negative impact on students' studies and take up time that they are supposed to involved in other activities which are good for their personal development. Students will get distracted and lose track of time when watching TV especially no parents are by their side. As a result, students won't be able to concentrate on their studies if they watch TV excessively unlimited, leading to poor study outcomes and academic performance.Additionally, since students are indulged in watching TV, they're hardly interested in join the interactive activities such as reading, singsing and communication which are beneficial for their brain development.

Moreover,long scree time will impact their development of social skills negatively. As students sit in front of TV everyday staring at the screen rather than playing with friends and communicating with adults, they'll get eccentrick gradually and be reluctant to express their opinions or to understand others' ideas. As a result,without good language capability, it will difficult for these kids to gain knowledge and learn from others, even achieve academic success. 

On the hand, I admit that sometimes watching TV can play a bit role on students' studies. For the visual information and plots make it easy to understand and comprehend, therefore the learning journy can be interesting.For example,history documentaries helps student understand history events because they're contained photos.Listening to teacher on class solely can be boring. Additionally, learning another language can be miseral, but by watching foreigh-language channels and how daily communications in foreigners, students can be more interested in learning languages.

In conclusion, parents and teachers should impose restrictions on the length of screen time when students watch TV, as watching too much TV would impact their study and development. Though sometimes TV can be teaching aid to make study more interesting.
