Many educational programs, such as Sesame Street, help young learners develop essential literacy and numeracy skills in an engaging way(E).Additionally, documentaries and science shows introduce children to complex topics in an easily understandable format, sparking curiosity and broadening their knowledge(E). Unlike traditional textbooks, television appeals to both visual and auditory learners, making learning more accessible and interactive(E).For example, language learning programs allow children to improve pronunciation and vocabulary through repeated exposure to native speakers(E). Therefore, incorporating television as a learning tool can make education more enjoyable and effective(L).
          

### Body Paragraph 2

Despite these advantages, excessive dependence on television for learning can be detrimental. One major drawback is that watching TV is a passive activity, which does not require active engagement or critical thinking.Meanwhile, traditional learning methods, such as reading, writing, and discussions, encourage deeper understanding and the development of analytical skills by requiring active involvement.Furthermore, prolonged screen time can negatively affect children's health and social development. Studies have shown that excessive television viewing reduces physical activity, contributing to obesity and limiting real-life interactions. For instance, children who spend too much time watching educational programs may miss opportunities for hands-on learning experiences, such as experiments and group discussions, which are essential for cognitive and social growth.



**In conclusion, parents and teachers should impose restrictions on the length of screen time when students watch TV, as watching too much TV would impact their study and development. Though sometimes TV can be teaching aid to make study more interesting.**
*In conclusion, while television can occasionally enhance learning by making it more engaging and accessible,its excessive use can harm children's academic performance, social development, and overall growth. Therefore, parents and educators should impose strict limits on screen time and ensure that TV is used as a complementary educational tool rather than a primary method of learning.*
