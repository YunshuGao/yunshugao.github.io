## 👩‍🏫 What I Observed

- Year 8 Geography: students engaged well with interactive maps  
- Year 10: struggled with motivation — teacher used mini whiteboards to increase attention

## 💭 What I Learned

- Scaffolding works better than long explanation  
- I need to be more confident giving short instructions
