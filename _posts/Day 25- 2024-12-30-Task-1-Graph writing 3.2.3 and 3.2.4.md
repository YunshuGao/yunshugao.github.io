#### Essay
The charts present the findings of a survey about what British students considered when choosing a tertiary institution in two different years.
The availability of suitable courses and degrees was the most important consideration in both years, although the proportion of students who chose this factor dropped from 40% to 34%. The cost of education was the next consideration in 1982, mentioned by 28% of students, but the figure decreased sharply to 5% in 2002.  A similar trend was seen in the attitude towards the distance to parental homes, with the figure declining from 19% to 16%.
Different patterns were seen in the changes to other three factors. The proportion of students who focused on the reputation of the university increased fivefold to 25%, while the percentage of those who valued the access to amentities and sports facilities more than tripled to 18% in 2002. By comparison, only a fraction of respondents chose admission criteria (2% and 3% respectively in these two years).
Overall, university applicants in the UK paid closer attention to suitable courses and degrees than to any other factor. The fame of a university and the access to amenities or sports facilities increased in importance, while the weight of other factors dropped or remained basically unchanged.

Waste production was noticeably lower in other countries.While the figures for ireland and Poland increased slightly to 3 and 5 million tonnes respectively in 2000, the waste produced in Portugal remained roughly unchanged at around 10 million.
